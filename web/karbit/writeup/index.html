        Create a sandboxed iframe to prevent alert from being triggered.

        We only need to allow scripts, same origin, and popups, you can check the doc here:
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox

        Because the iframe have recursion prevention system that stated here:
        https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-frames-970331#Infinite%20Recursion
        the frame will eventually stop the recursion redirect through the document.referrer and execute our payload.

        There is other way to bypass this, but this is the shortest way to do it.
        As example you can use csp to prevent the frame from redirecting to document.referrer.
